-- | Shared wallets are a new kind of wallet owned by one or more co-signers.
-- | In this type of wallet, addresses are defined by two monetary scripts
-- | (one for ownership of assets, one for ownership of stake).
--
-- | Shared wallet is instantiated with an account public key, derivation path needed to
-- | recreate it,  and a complete set of information that is needed to discover shared
-- | addresses. In order to enable the discovery the following is needed:
--
-- | - a way to determine what range of indices are checked on the
-- |   ledger. Mechanism of address pool gap, adopted for sequential wallets,
-- |   is used. The idea is to track all indices starting from 0 and up to N.
-- |   N is variable as addresses are discovered (and marked as Used in consequence).
-- |   The pool of addresses is enlarged in such way that the number of consecutive
-- |   Unsed addresses equals to address pool gap.
--
-- | - script template for payment credential contains information about all collected
-- |   account public keys for all parties engaged, here named cosigners. Also the skeleton
-- |   determining script structure is provided.  In this sense script is predetermined from
-- |   the beginning and can variate only in verification key part. The places where a specific
-- |   cosigner is present is to be replaced with the derived verfication keys from the cosigner's
-- |   account public key and the index that was chosen. The index for derivation is the same
-- |   for each cosigner's derivation. Moreover, script template could be translated into
-- |   a corresponding script only when account public keys for all cosigners specified in script
-- |   are collected. Hence, this module provides methods for updating script templates that handles
-- |   the act of collecting account public key for cosigner. Finally, verification keys are derived
-- |   using role=3 for payment credential.
--
-- | - optional script template for delegation credential contains all information as in case of
-- |   the script template for payment credential. One different is that the verification keys are derived
-- |   using role=4 for delegation credential.
--
-- | When both script are present, the base address (with both credential) is expected to be discovered.
-- | When script template for delegation credential is missing then enterprise address (non-stakable) is
-- | expected.
